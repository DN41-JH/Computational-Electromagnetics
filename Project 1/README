This is my first Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) project, which is a Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation for the radiation of single frequency source(s), subject to the Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) absorbing boundary condition.


Project background and motivation:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Maxwell’s equations set describes the fundamental relationship between the electromagnetic fields and their source, therefore, solving Maxwell’s equations allow us to obtain realistic description of the spatial distribution and time-evolution of electromagnetic fields given a certain source within certain media. However, the real world engineering problems, which usually involves solving for the field within inhomogeneous or anisotropic media with arbitrary boundary shape and boundary condition, do not guarantee a simple and ideal object configurations and propagation mediz. Consequently, in many of the real world engineering problems, it becomes inpractical to solve Maxwell’s equations analytically. Fortunately, with the development of modern electronic computer, numerical solutions of Maxwell’s equations become available as different numerical methods are developed to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations efficiently. FDTD method is one the most popular numerical methods to approximate solutions of Maxwell’s equations in the time domain. The specific FDTD scheme used by computational electromagnetics was developed by Kane S. Yee in 1966. 

  One of the challenges in computational electromagnetics is to simulate radiation and scattering problems in open space. Appropriate absorbing boundary condition must be adopted such that the numerical reflection of waves at the numerical boundary of the simulation domain is minimized. If the absorbing boundary condition is poorly designed and implemented, then the field distribution within the computational domain will be severely distorted away from the desired field propagation in open space due to the numerical reflection at the numerical boundary. In this project we applied the PML absorbing boundary condition to simulate the open space environment. PML was firstly formulated by Berenger in 1994 using the split field method, then Chew and Weedon showed that it can also be understood from the perspective of stretched coordinates[1]. Neither of the two perceptions of PML has physical meaning, and are purely designed and formulated mathematically. Later people found the special anisotropic media is equivalent to PML.

  In this project, I first formulated the basic 2D FDTD time stepping equations of interested field components, based on Yee’s grid. After validating the FDTD codes with an infinitely long single frequency current source polarized in z-direction radiating within a PEC cavity, I incorporated the PML between the computational domain and the PEC boundary to simulate the same line current source radiating in free space.
