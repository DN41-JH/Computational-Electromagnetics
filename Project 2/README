This is my second Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) project, which is a finite element analysis of the generalized eigenvalue problem in the homogeneous rectangular waveguide.

Project background and motivation:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Maxwell’s equations set describes the fundamental relationship between the electromagnetic fields and their source, therefore, solving Maxwell’s equations allow us to obtain realistic description of the spatial distribution and time-evolution of electromagnetic fields given a certain source within certain media. However, the real world engineering problems, which usually involves solving for the field within inhomogeneous or anisotropic media with arbitrary boundary shape and boundary condition, do not guarantee a simple and ideal object configurations and propagation mediz. Consequently, in many of the real world engineering problems, it becomes inpractical to solve Maxwell’s equations analytically.

  Fortunately, with the development of modern electronic computer, numerical solutions of Maxwell’s equations become available as various numerical methods are developed to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations efficiently. Finite Element Method (FEM) is one of the most popular numerical methods to approximate solutions of Maxwell’s equations (mostly in the frequency domain). FEM is powerful in its robustness of discretizing arbitrary and irregular computational domain by adjusting the shape of its elements, efficiency of dealing various boundary conditions, and accuracy in solving the required partial differential equation(s). In FEM formulation of scalar field problem, the scalar field quantity to be solved is approximated within each element by an interpolation function, which is usually first or high order polynomial function of space (with the scalar field values on nodes of the element being the coefficients of the spatial variable), then the entire partial differential equation is multiplied with the interpolation function, then integrated over the entire computational domain. After substituting the quantity to be solved with its interpolation function and imposing certain boundary condition(s), the integral equation on the interested partial differential equation can be written as a linear system. Solving the linear system yields the solution of the interested scalar field on each node of the element, and plugging it back to the interpolation function will complete the approximation expression of scalar field within each element. Usually the higher the order of the interpolation function we adopt, the fewer number of elements is required to achieve the same level of accuracy obtained by lower order interpolation function with more number of elements.

  In this project, I studied the generalized eigenvalue problem on the field distribution within a homogeneous rectangular waveguide, using FEM. I formulated the integral equation on the interest partial differential equations to be solved, and discretized the rectangular computational domain using triangle elements to generate a desired 2D mesh. Then I formulated the discretized equation based on my discretization of the rectangular computational domain, along with the corresponding linear system to solve. Finally, I solved the resulting linear system to obtain the apprxoimated solution, and analyzed the result on both cut-off frequency and corresponding 2D field distribution obtained by my FEM program.
